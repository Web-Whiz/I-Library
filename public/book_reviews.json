    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "publication_year": 1925,
    "genre": "Fiction",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "review_text": "The Great Gatsby is a timeless classic that delves into the excesses and disillusionment of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's prose is exquisite, painting a vivid picture of opulent parties and unattainable dreams. The characters are complex and flawed, particularly Jay Gatsby, whose pursuit of the American Dream ultimately leads to tragedy. The novel's exploration of wealth, love, and social status remains relevant today. I was captivated by the intricacies of the characters' lives and the symbolism woven throughout the narrative.",
